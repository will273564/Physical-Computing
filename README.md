  <dt>What are microcontrollers?</dt>
  A microcontroller is a small, low-cost and self contained computer-on-a-chip that can be used as an embedded system. A few microcontrollers may utilize four-bit expressions and work at clock rate frequencies,

  <dd>What does it do?</dd>
  A microbit is a small microprocessor that is programmed through the microbit website and then uploaded to the computer. It features 25 buttons that can light up red and two buttons (a and b) that are used to trigger certain events.

  <dd>What does it do?</dd>
 Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online.

# Different Types Of Sensors
<dt>What are sensors?</dt>
a sensor is a device which detects or measures a physical property and records, indicates, or otherwise responds to it.
<dt>Different types of sensors:</dt>

<dd>What does it do?</dd>
A motion sensor maps its location and updates every certain amount of time. If a large change in layout is detected a certain action will be performed (such as an alarm ringing.)

# Different Types Of Actuators
<dt>What are actuators?</dt>
An actuator is a component of a machine that is responsible for moving and controlling a mechanism or system. They can be used to open hinges or move parts of a machine.
<dt>Different types of actuators:</dt>
<dd>Electrical powered:</dd>

<dd>What does it do?</dd>
An electrical powered actuator is an actuator that is powered by electricity. It usually includes a circuit board and wires to program. This is a more advanced type of actuator and is used in many modorn day appliances.

<dd>What does it do?</dd>
A motion actuator is an actuator that powers itself when it is extended by human effort and will automatically retract, like the actuator in an auto-shutting door.
