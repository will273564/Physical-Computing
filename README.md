  <dt>What are microcontrollers?</dt>
  A microcontroller is a small, low-cost and self contained computer-on-a-chip that can be used as an embedded system. A few microcontrollers may utilize four-bit expressions and work at clock rate frequencies,

  <dd>What does it do?</dd>
  A microbit is a small microprocessor that is programmed through the microbit website and then uploaded to the computer. It features 25 buttons that can light up red and two buttons (a and b) that are used to trigger certain events.

  <dd>What does it do?</dd>
 Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online.
